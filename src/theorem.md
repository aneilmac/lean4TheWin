# It's Just a Theorem

> [!WARNING]
> TODO 
> - Intro Curry Howard Isomorphism. 
    - Takeaway should be: if a function can be defined, that is a proof.
> - Introduce `theorem five_eq_five : 5 = 5 := rfl`
> - Explain type is `Prop`
> - `noncomputable` 
> - Explain definition is `rfl` tactic.
> - Prop vs Bool
> - `=` vs `==`
> - `by` keyword
> - `rw` tactic applied
> - `exact` tactic
> - Some Nat tactics
